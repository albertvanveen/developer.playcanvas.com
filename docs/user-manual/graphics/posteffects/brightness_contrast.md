The brightness-contrast effect allows you to modify the brightness and contrast of the rendered image.

Here is an image without the effect:

![Image without effect](/images/user-manual/graphics/posteffects/without-effects.png)

And the same image with the effect applied and changes to brightness and contrast:

![Image with effect](/images/user-manual/graphics/posteffects/with-brightness-contrast.png)

The built-in brightness-contrast effect has the following attributes:

* **Brightness**: The brightness of the image. Ranges from -1 to 1 (-1 is solid black, 0 no change, 1 solid white).
* **Contrast**: The contrast of the image. Ranges from -1 to 1 (-1 is solid gray, 0 no change, 1 maximum contrast).

Find the post-processing effect script on [GitHub][3].
