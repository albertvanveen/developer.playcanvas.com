PlayCanvas supports the adding post-processing effects to your projects. Post effects modify the final rendered image and provide an easy way for you to add some visual flare to your application.

We have implemented post effects as scripts that you can add to an Entity that has a [Camera][1] component attached. To add post effects to a camera, do the following:

1. Choose one of the effects below and get the script from the GitHub link.
  * [Bloom][3]
  * [Brightness-Contrast][4]
  * [Hue-Saturation][5]
  * [FXAA][6]
  * [Sepia][7]
  * [Vignette][8]
2. Add a [Script][9] component to the Entity representing your camera.
3. Assign the desired post effect scripts to the camera entity's Script component. Note that the order in which the post effect script are listed in the Script component determine the order in which they are applied.

You can also create your own post effects. You can find some additional ones on [GitHub][2].
